# Specification Quality Checklist: LXD Sandbox for Autonomous Claude Code

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is a baseline spec documenting already-built functionality. All requirements are derived from the existing, working implementation.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the feature description was comprehensive and complete.
- The spec references specific CLI commands and paths (e.g., `sandbox.sh claude`, `/home/ubuntu/project`) because these are user-facing interface contracts, not implementation details. They describe WHAT the user interacts with, not HOW the system implements it internally.
- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
